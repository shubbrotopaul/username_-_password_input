This Python script enhances user privacy by allowing them to input a username and password discreetly. It begins by prompting the user for their username and password. The script then calculates the length of the password and generates a hidden version using asterisks. The final step involves displaying a message to the user, incorporating their username, a visually obscured representation of the password, and the length of the password. This approach provides a balance between maintaining security and keeping the user informed about their password characteristics.

Code Breakdown:


* User Input:
The script utilizes the input function to gather the user's username and password.

username = input('What is your username?')

password = input('What is your password?')


* Password Length Calculation:
The code determines the length of the entered password using the 'len' function.

password_length = len(password)


* Password Obfuscation:
The script creates a string of asterisks ('*') with a length equal to the password length, offering a visual concealment of the password.

hiding_password = '*' * password_length


* Output Message:
Finally, the script prints a message that includes the username, the obscured password, and the length of the password.

print(f'{username}, your password {hiding_password}, is {password_length} letters long')

* Example Output:

What is your username?john_doe

What is your password?secretp@ssword

john_doe, your password ************, is 12 letters long
